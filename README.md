## Notes about the app when viewing it

- When reaching the progress tracker page, the second map shows a marker of the user's location, but since we're in Berlin it needs to be zoomed out
- after selecting a cafe/restaurant as a stop and giving access to location, it might still render the mock location for the map, so please use refresh or the back button on the app (when i was testing the app my permission to location was set on always)
